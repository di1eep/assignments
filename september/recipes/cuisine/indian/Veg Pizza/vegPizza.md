# Simple Recipe For a Delicious Vegetable Pizza:

# Ingredients:

# For the Pizza Dough:

2 and 1/4 teaspoons (1 packet) active dry yeast

1 teaspoon sugar

1 and 1/2 cups warm water

3 and 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

2 tablespoons olive oil

1 teaspoon salt

# For the Pizza Sauce:

1 can (14 oz) crushed tomatoes

1 clove garlic, minced

1 teaspoon dried oregano

1 teaspoon dried basil

Salt and pepper to taste

# For Toppings (you can customize as per your preference):

1 bell pepper, thinly sliced

1 small onion, thinly sliced

1 small zucchini, thinly sliced

1 small tomato, thinly sliced

1/2 cup sliced olives (optional)

1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

# Instructions:

For the Pizza Dough:

In a small bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes, or until it becomes frothy.

In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, olive oil, and salt. Pour in the yeast mixture and stir until it forms a dough.

Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes, or until it becomes smooth and elastic.

Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size.

For the Pizza Sauce:

In a small saucepan, combine crushed tomatoes, minced garlic, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer over low heat for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Assembling the Pizza:

Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while it's preheating.

Punch down the risen dough and divide it into two equal portions. Roll out each portion into a thin circle on a floured surface.

Place the rolled-out dough on a pizza stone or a baking sheet.

Spread a layer of the pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust.

Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce.

Arrange your choice of vegetables on top of the cheese. You can get creative with the toppings!

Finally, sprinkle the grated Parmesan cheese over the top.

Bake in the preheated oven for about 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.

Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing.

Enjoy your delicious homemade vegetable pizza!

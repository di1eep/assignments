## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and considerate of other contributors.
- Use welcoming and inclusive language.

---

## Formatting Standards

- Recipes should be written in Markdown (.md) format.
- Follow the template provided in the [README.md](./README.md) for recipe formatting.

---

## Commit Messages

- Use clear and concise commit messages.
- Begin commit messages with a capital letter and avoid ending them with a period.
- Use the imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Adds feature").
  
    Good: `git commit -m "Add chocolate chip cookie recipe"`
  
    Bad: `git commit -m "added code"`

## Issue Reporting

- Report issues or propose enhancements using the GitHub Issue Tracker.
- Be detailed in your issue description and always attach relevant labels.
  
---

## Code Reviews

- Actively engage in the code review process to ensure quality and consistency.
- Offer constructive feedback.
- Commits should only be merged after passing the code review by a maintainer or recipe reviewer.

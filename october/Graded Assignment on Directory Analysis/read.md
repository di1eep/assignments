1) We start by validating the command-line arguments, checking if the provided path exists and is a directory.

2) We create an error log file and initialize a PrintWriter to log errors and exceptions.

3) We traverse the specified directory and its subdirectories, identifying ".txt" files and processing them. During processing, we also calculate word frequencies.

4) After processing all files, we calculate the total size of ".txt" files and display the top 10 most frequent words.

5) Errors and exceptions are logged to the "error.log" file.
